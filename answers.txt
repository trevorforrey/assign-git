What is a gitignore file and what should it include for a Java project?

- A gitignore file tells git what folders, files, and file extensions
to not track the changes on. In a Java project, you should include .class files
and other IDE specific files in your gitignore. This way you aren't bugged
about files that don't matter as much to your project.

What does fast-forward in Git mean?

- A fast-forward is when you are updating a branch to the state of another
and don't have any merge conflicts, so you can safely be fast-forwarded to
the state of the new branch.

Why should you have different branches?

- You should have different branches because development isn't a straightforward
process. It takes experimentation, failure, and a lot of collaboration in order
to successfully finish a product. Using different branches allows developers to 
go through the natural process of development while organizing their work in 
different branches.

In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?

- In most projects, you usually just have one remote Git Repo. This remote repo
is taken as the global state of the project, which all developers can update and
pull from.
